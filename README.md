# Task Tracker (Python OOP Project)

A simple console-based task tracker built to practice and reinforce Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

This project was created as a learning exercise to better understand class design, inheritance, abstraction, and project structure.

---

## Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to:

- Practice core OOP principles
- Work with abstract base classes
- Use inheritance and polymorphism
- Structure a small Python project using packages
- Implement a simple CLI (Command Line Interface)
- Manage multiple related objects (tasks, projects, manager)

---

## OOP Concepts Used

- Abstract Base Class (`Task`)
- Inheritance (`BugTask`, `FeatureTask`, `ChoreTask`)
- Encapsulation
- Composition (Project contains Tasks)
- Aggregation (TaskManager contains Projects)
- Properties
- Class attributes (auto-increment ID system)

---

## Features

- Create and manage multiple projects
- Add different types of tasks:
  - Bug
  - Feature
  - Chore
- Task statuses:
  - `todo`
  - `in_progress`
  - `done`
- Start and complete tasks
- Project-level statistics
- Global statistics across all projects
- Simple console interface
